# Deep Learning Template

A basic template for personal use for deep learning projects. Feel free to use it, though I hardly fathom why you'd actually want to >.>

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

Install these libraries before using it.

## Project Structure

The directory structure should be like this:

```
main.py
readme.md
--venv/
--data/
----Test/
----Train/
--training_models/
--custom_dataloaders/

```

The `venv` and `data` folders are not included in the project.

Use absolute pathing for the data locations.
